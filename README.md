# SansTale

An Undertale Fangame written in Love2D.

Love2D can be downloaded for free at <https://love2d.org>.

## What's the point?

This is a fangame that is Undertale, but from Sans' perspective.
**However!** It isn't just a re-skin,
because of the following plans (mark them as done when time comes):
+ Sans is *far* from a silent protagonist,
he will comment on stuff when you check them,
and maybe break the 4th wall occasionally
+ The story is experienced very differently from canon Undertale
STATUS: there is no story yet, and **I'll be glad if anyone contributes ideas**
+ Game mechanics, such as teleporting, attack mechanics

(Feel free to fork this and/or contribute)
